# Decisions — Cancer Transcriptomics Teaching Suite

Analysis decisions that a reader could reasonably have made differently, with the
evidence that settled them. Not a changelog: record the ones where the outcome
would change if the decision changed.

Newest first. One entry per decision, and never delete one — a superseded
decision is marked superseded, with a pointer to the entry that replaced it.

Template for a new entry:

## D-001 — <one-line statement of the decision>

**Date:** YYYY-MM-DD · **Status:** decided | superseded by D-00N

**Context.** What made this a question.

**Options.** What was actually considered, including the one not taken.

**Decision.** What was chosen.

**Evidence.** The number, plot or run that settled it. A decision with no
evidence line is a preference — say so rather than dressing it up.

**Consequence.** What now depends on this, and what would have to be redone if
it were reversed.

## D-005 — JupyterLite DE: precomputed grids plus live scipy tests, not live pydeseq2 (TODO.md D17)

**Date:** 2026-09-26 · **Status:** decided

**Context.** D4 left open whether the M5 notebook re-runs pydeseq2 in the browser. P1.5 fixed the
rule as `decide()` in `scripts/python/spike_pyodide.py`, committed in 247d3f5 before anything ran.
The record is `deliverables/2026-09-26_lite_build_pyodide_spike_v1.csv`.

**Options.** Live pydeseq2 0.5.4 in JupyterLite; the D4 fallback, precomputed grids plus live
scipy tests; live pydeseq2 under an in-process joblib backend, which the rule does not cover.

**Decision.** The fallback at all three grid sizes, 1,000 x 24, 20,000 x 24 and 20,000 x 200, with
plotly for figures. Stage B, the browser timing, did not run, because no size passed stage A.

**Evidence.** Stage A ran npm `pyodide@314.0.6`, Python 3.14.2, under Node v24.15.0 on macOS
15.7.9 arm64. npm integrity:
`sha512-BKDTJyIqFxC4BExLqeRS3f5xvXZIjOt8C3zGLN/Cc7tFxSwvKVhVkchQQ2AGLOtR4YrVOIFxbV8poyDOOmWwxQ==`.
- micropip installed pydeseq2 0.5.4 as 47 files of 41,800,855 bytes. anndata 0.13.4 arrived with
  typing-extensions 4.16.0 from PyPI, because the bundled 4.15.0 was never loaded, so the known
  risk did not fire in Node.
- The fit failed at every size. First blocking error, verbatim:
  `AssertionError: ThreadingBackend does not accept setting the inner_max_num_threads argument.`
  pydeseq2 0.5.4, the newest release on PyPI, wraps every inference call in
  `parallel_backend("loky", inner_max_num_threads=1)`. Pyodide has no loky, joblib 1.5.3 falls
  back to threading, and threading rejects that argument. No version pin reaches it.
- Loaded versions, Pyodide then CPython: numpy 2.4.6 and 2.5.3, scipy 1.18.0 and 1.18.1,
  scikit-learn 1.8.0 and 1.9.1, pandas 3.0.2 and 3.0.6, pydeseq2 0.5.4 in both.
- At 20,000 x 200, wheels plus data are 56,385,918 bytes, over the 50,000,000 limit, so that size
  fails even with a working fit.
- Fallback arm: in a Pyodide where `import pydeseq2` raises `ModuleNotFoundError`, scipy 1.18.0,
  pandas 3.0.2 and plotly 7.1.0 installed as 10 files of 32,226,431 bytes. Mann-Whitney U with BH
  matched CPython at every size: max |dp| 2.2e-16, max |dpadj| 5.6e-16, and no gene crossed 0.05.
- Recorded beside the rule, which never reads it: with a sequential joblib backend registered as
  `in_process`, pydeseq2 fits in Pyodide in 6.6, 38.5 and 44.8 s of Node time. It agrees at
  1,000 x 24 (0 disagreements, max |dLFC| 2.2e-5) and at 20,000 x 200 (0, 2.8e-4) but not at
  20,000 x 24: 389 disagreements, of which 388 are low-count genes, baseMean 0.27 to 1.34, whose
  padj is NaN in Pyodide only. Independent filtering chose a different threshold.

**Consequence.** Phase 5 bundles precomputed DE grids and runs the scipy tests live. Reversing this
needs a new decision: the backend shim changes the notebook's code path, 20,000 x 24 still
disagrees under it, its wheels alone take 41.8 MB of the 50 MB budget, and no browser timing
exists. A numpy change that alters `counts()` fails `tests/test_spike_record.py`; the spike is
then rerun.

## D-004 — Output root: the laptop profile defaults to the working directory; hpc needs an explicit root

**Date:** 2026-09-26 · **Status:** decided

**Context.** `settings/paths.toml` refuses guessed roots, because on the cluster a fallback
writes where nobody looks. Students run `ctx` from a course folder on a laptop.

**Options.** Always require `--root` or `CTX_ROOT`; default to the working directory everywhere;
default to it on the laptop profile only.

**Decision.** `--root`, then `CTX_ROOT`, then the working directory on `laptop`. `hpc` raises
without an explicit root. The resolved root is printed and written into every `_README.md`.

**Evidence.** None measured; this is a preference. The cluster risk is the one the template's
`settings/paths.toml` comment records.

**Consequence.** P1.6 tests the precedence. Reversing it changes where every student output lands.

## D-003 — ctx does not import labcore at runtime (TODO.md D15)

**Date:** 2026-09-26 · **Status:** decided

**Context.** `AGENTS.md` routes every reusable helper through the pinned `labcore` package.

**Options.** Depend on labcore after upstream changes (inline plotly, a theme toggle, a unit
column), or keep ctx self-contained with labcore in the environment for `labdocs` only.

**Decision.** Self-contained. Chosen by Rytis at the 2026-09-26 check-in.

**Evidence.** In labcore v0.6.6: `viz/save.py:147` writes plotly HTML with
`include_plotlyjs="cdn"`, one file per theme; the `write_table` README dictionary is
`Column | Dtype | Description`, with no unit (`io.py:239-273`); a CSV write is refused unless
`settings/formats.toml` lists it or `override=True` is passed; the Okabe-Ito order at
`viz/palette.py:60-61` puts `#CC79A7` fourth and `#F0E442` seventh, the reverse of
`CONVENTIONS.md`.

**Consequence.** Conformance level 5 ("labcore used for viz/IO") is unreachable. P1.2 adds an
AST test that fails on any `labcore` import under `src/ctx`.

## D-002 — Plan files moved to the template's locations; project rules live in CONVENTIONS.md (TODO.md D14)

**Date:** 2026-09-26 · **Status:** decided

**Context.** Copier owns `CLAUDE.md` and does not skip it when it exists. `TODO.md` and
`knowledge/lessons.md` are skip-if-exists, and on this case-insensitive disk `TODO.md` already
resolved to the root `todo.md`.

**Options.** Move and import (chosen); merge the project rules into `AGENTS.md`; keep the files at
the root and hand-merge `CLAUDE.md`.

**Decision.** `todo.md` became `TODO.md`, `lessons.md` became `knowledge/lessons.md`, and
`CLAUDE.md` became `CONVENTIONS.md`, which the generated `CLAUDE.md` imports. Where
`CONVENTIONS.md` conflicts with `AGENTS.md`, `CONVENTIONS.md` wins. `/data/`, `/resources/` and a
`tests/fixtures/**` re-include were added to `.gitignore`.

**Evidence.** Commit 45632ed is exactly three `R100` renames. The `copier copy` log (v0.9.10) has
0 overwrites and `conflict`/`skip` for `TODO.md` and `knowledge/lessons.md` only; all three files
kept their SHA-256.

**Consequence.** `copier update` merges against two appended lines in `CLAUDE.md` and `AGENTS.md`
instead of the whole rule set.

## D-001 — `src/ctx` is an installable package, an exception to "no shared helper module"

**Date:** 2026-09-26 · **Status:** decided

**Context.** `AGENTS.md` puts every runnable step in `scripts/<lang>/` and forbids a shared
helper module in the repo; `labdocs` walks only `scripts/`, `bin/` and `containers/`.

**Options.** A typer CLI package in `src/ctx`, or scripts only.

**Decision.** The teaching product is the `ctx` package in `src/` (`CONVENTIONS.md`, Stack).
One-off steps such as fixture builders and spikes stay in `scripts/python/` with codebase-meta
blocks.

**Evidence.** None measured; this is a requirement: students install and run one CLI.

**Consequence.** `labdocs` does not document `src/ctx`, `knowledge/api_index.md` does not index
it, and the file-length ratchet does not cover it. Conformance stays at 1 until raised on purpose.
