# Decisions — Cancer Transcriptomics Teaching Suite

Analysis decisions that a reader could reasonably have made differently, with the
evidence that settled them. Not a changelog: record the ones where the outcome
would change if the decision changed.

Newest first. One entry per decision, and never delete one — a superseded
decision is marked superseded, with a pointer to the entry that replaced it.

Template for a new entry:

## D-001 — <one-line statement of the decision>

**Date:** YYYY-MM-DD · **Status:** decided | superseded by D-00N

**Context.** What made this a question.

**Options.** What was actually considered, including the one not taken.

**Decision.** What was chosen.

**Evidence.** The number, plot or run that settled it. A decision with no
evidence line is a preference — say so rather than dressing it up.

**Consequence.** What now depends on this, and what would have to be redone if
it were reversed.

## D-024 — Figures take the Candida Ribo-seq style; the Helvetica and 14 pt overrides are dropped

**Date:** 2026-09-29 · **Status:** decided

**Context.** Rytis asked for the figure styling and parameters of the Candida FINAL figures (`riboseq_public_candida/deliverables/FINAL/figures/pdf`). This project had overridden the global figure rules with Helvetica and a 14 pt base (TODO.md, Phase 1 table); the Candida figures follow the global rules. The same day he asked for the ALI report's page design and the riboseq status report's split of page text into files (Phase 2S).

**Options.** Copy Candida's mechanism too, one TOML read by one module with an environment override, or change the values in `style.py`, which is already the one place a size or colour is set. The TOML adds a loader and its validation for one reader; `style.py` it is.

**Decision.** Taken from Candida, measured on its 32 PDFs and its `settings/figure_style.toml`:
- Arial, Liberation Sans, DejaVu Sans; 12 pt panel letters (bold capitals), 10 pt axis titles, 9 pt ticks, legends, annotations and captions, nothing under 8 pt.
- 3 pt ticks pointing out, minor ticks at the axis width; 6 pt points at alpha 0.5; grid #E6E6E6 at 1 pt (#39424A dark, from Candida's own dark scripts).
- No seaborn `paper` context: every rc is set in `style.py`.

Not taken, and why:
- Candida's light-only output: CONVENTIONS requires `_white` and `_black`.
- Its condition pair (blue and purple) and its domain colours: here the role pair reference #0072B2 and comparison #D55E00 matches the volcano's down and up.
- Free page heights: heights stay derived from aspect ratios.
- Creation timestamps: from Phase 2D figure files carry none.
- dpi 1000: only PDF and SVG are written, so it would change nothing.
- A panel-letter helper: no figure has panels yet; the style is set in `PANEL_LABEL`.

Two defects found on the way, fixed at their source:
- **Log-axis labels.** Matplotlib labels a log axis in mathtext, whose exponent is 0.7 of the tick size (8.4 pt at 12 pt, 6.3 pt at 9 pt) and whose SVG names one font instead of the chain. The MA and dispersion figures carried both. `scatter._plain_log_ticks` labels 100, 1,000, 10,000. The measured-figure test had no log axis; an MA contract joins it, and the SVG check is now equality per text element.
- **Screen sizes (mine, 2026-09-28).** `on_page` added 4 to a size in pt and used it as px, so the plots on a page ran 0 pt larger, not 3. It now returns `(pt + 3) * 96/72` px, serves the Plotly templates only, and a test holds the numbers; page text is set in px on its own (18 px base, unchanged).

**Evidence.** Every figure of the synthetic M5 run, 20 files in both themes, measured from the PDF and SVG before and after:

| Measure | Before | After |
|---|---|---|
| PDF font | Helvetica | ArialMT |
| PDF text sizes (Tf) | 8.4, 12, 14 | 9, 10 |
| PDF line widths | 0, 0.8, 1, 1.5 | 0, 1, 1.5 |
| SVG font-family | the chain, and `'Helvetica'` alone on log labels | `'Arial', 'Liberation Sans', 'DejaVu Sans', sans-serif` only |
| Page widths | 240.945, 481.890 pt | the same |

The M6 figures (10 files) measure the same as M5's after. Layout constants measured at 14 pt, measured again: at 9 pt a box plot fits 4 features in 85 mm and overlaps at 5 (`SINGLE_COLUMN_MAX_FEATURES` 3 to 4); 20 horizontal bars stop overlapping from 3.0 mm per row, and `BAR_ROW_MM` goes from 7 to 4.5 mm, the 4.1 mm line pitch of a 9 pt label plus a gap. Mutations that each fail a test: the log labels back to mathtext, a 14 pt annotation, a two-font SVG chain.

**Consequence.** No frozen file changed; `annotate.py` reads the new sizes through the names it already imports. Phase 1's records of the 14 pt figures stay as history.

## D-023 — Rytis's draft v3.10 merged: contour figures and cividis for continuous colour

**Date:** 2026-09-29 · **Status:** decided

**Context.** Rytis put draft v3.10 in `TEMP/` (`todo7.md`, `CLAUDE7.md`): contour figures in M2, M5, M6, M7 and M10 (two-knob maps, power maps, density contours, a likelihood concept figure) and cividis for continuous colour in both themes.

**Options.** Carry the draft as written, or item by item as in D-020 and D-021.

**Decision.** Item by item; what was carried and why is in TODO.md, "Merge of draft v3.10".
- Cividis is for sequential values, with isolines and labels in ink. The P2Q.6 heatmap keeps its diverging two-colour scale.
- The contour helpers and the M5 contour figures go in Phase 2D, after the record, because `src/ctx/de` is frozen until then.

**Evidence.**
- Cividis's ends, measured with the WCAG formula on matplotlib 3.11.2's map: #FEE838 is 1.25:1 against white and #00224E is 1.34:1 against black. A line or label in either end colour vanishes on that theme's page.
- The draft's claims checked on 2026-09-29, one verdict each in the merge record: cividis in both renderers and its source (PMID 30067751), the 1.92 and 3.00 likelihood drops (χ² quantiles halved: 1.9207, 2.9957), Schoenfeld (PMID 6354290) and the continuous-covariate form (Hsieh and Lavori, PMID 11146149), and pydeseq2 0.5.4's dispersion attributes, which answer the draft's one verify item.
- No frozen file changed; `~/ctx_tier1/data/raw` still held only `tier1_meta`.

**Consequence.** The style tokens gain cividis's stops when the helpers are built, so the measured-colour tests accept it. The drafts moved to `../RNAseq_tutorial_archive/TEMP_2026-09-29c/`.

## D-022 — The Trim Galore reports leave the cluster; the GENCODE 50 GTF is a resource; registered again

**Date:** 2026-09-29 · **Status:** decided

**Context.** The read-fates chart of Phase 2Q (P2Q.3) needs, per sample, the reads Trim Galore removed and why, and the rRNA share needs every gene's type. Neither was on the Mac: the reports stayed on the cluster, and the counts carry gene IDs without types. Both changes touch frozen files, `src/ctx/gather/rnaseq.py` and `conf/datasets/tier1.toml`, so they go in before cluster step 7 copies anything.

**Options.** Parse Trim Galore's numbers out of MultiQC's cluster report (`multiqc/`), which step 7 does not copy either and whose layout changes between MultiQC releases; or copy the per-sample reports (about 2.6 kB each) and parse them locally with MultiQC (Rytis's choice). For the gene types, a second annotation from another source, or the cluster's own GTF.

**Decision.**
- `COPIED_FILES` gains `trimgalore/*_trimming_report.txt`, and step 7's rsync the same `--include`.
- `test_repo::test_rsync_matches_copied_files` fails when the rsync and `COPIED_FILES` disagree in either direction, so the two lists of one thing stay one.
- `conf/datasets/tier1.toml` gains `annotation_gtf`, the file the cluster run used (`gencode.v50.primary_assembly.annotation.gtf.gz`), so gene IDs including `_PAR_Y` match the counts.
- The rules are registered again, at 2026-09-29 15:36.

**Evidence.**
- **The GTF,** downloaded on Rytis's approval on 2026-09-29: 124,650,284 bytes, MD5 289b91e5e95e8b0450d223246f10a12e, equal to the publisher's `release_50/MD5SUMS`; SHA-256 89bbad69a8c89fee5fadec0a2f14a098752d27a4ef7f24e4de9bac681e1b18f4.
- **The fixture,** rebuilt with `make_rnaseq_fixture.py --from-run` from the nf-core/rnaseq 3.27.0 test run of 2026-09-27 still in the scratchpad: the 14 files it held are byte-identical, 8 Trim Galore reports (32 kB) join them, and `tests/test_rnaseq_fixture.py` passes with the new pattern. The README now gives the run's date from its params file and the copy date apart.
- **No Step-1 count exists,** so registering again is allowed: `~/ctx_tier1/data/raw` held only `tier1_meta` at 15:36.

**Consequence.** Cluster step 7 waits for this commit. A sample whose report the rsync missed makes `ctx qc` fail on the Mac, not draw a chart without it.

## D-021 — Rytis's drafts v3.7–v3.9 merged: M10 clinical and survival, D27–D28, D3 and D6–D9; Phase 2Q planned

**Date:** 2026-09-29 · **Status:** decided

**Context.** Rytis put a third set of drafts in `TEMP/`: v3.7 (`todo4.md`, with `CLAUDE4.md`), which adds M10 on clinical covariates, treatment and survival, and v3.9 (`todo5.md`, byte-identical to `todo6.md`), which accepts the defaults of D3 and D6 to D9. He added `lessons5.md`, the lessons file of his planning sessions. The same day he approved the Phase 2Q plan: the read-fates bubble chart, pathway heatmaps and linked brushing.

**Options.** Copy the drafts over the repo files, which would undo D-020 and everything since; or merge item by item as in D-020.

**Decision.** Merge item by item. What was carried, what was not and why is in TODO.md, "Merge of drafts v3.7–v3.9".
- The drafts' D21 and D22 become D27 and D28; the drafts had numbered them after their own D20, which the repo had already used.
- M10 gets output number 12 and `ctx clinical`, so no output directory moves.
- The registration Phase 2Q needs is D-022, not D-021 as the approved plan numbered it: this merge came first.
- Phase 2Q brings forward, for Step-1, parts of M2 that D-020 put in Phase 3 (MultiQC's parse, the read-fates metrics, a flag-only status table, the `ctx qc` page) and the heatmaps TODO.md had in Phase 4. This amends D-020's "from Phase 3" for those items. (Added after the review of bb43cd5.)
- M10 fits Cox models with lifelines, which takes a pandas DataFrame, so CONVENTIONS.md's pandas boundary gains `ctx.clinical`. (Added after the review of bb43cd5.)

**Evidence.**
- **Claims checked at their sources** on 2026-09-29 (notes in the session scratchpad, `v39_facts/`), one verdict per claim in the merge record:
  - Verified: TCGA-CDR's endpoints and Table 3 recommendations, BRCA OS 151 events among 1,097 patients, the competing-risk tab, TCGA's rule against systemic therapy before procurement (42 neoadjuvant exceptions in the CDR, 102 GDC notifications; treatment for a prior malignancy may predate sampling), the CDR's ER+ vs ER− breast comparison, HPA's and bc-GenExMiner's best-cut-off splits, Lausen and Schumacher's corrected p, and GTEx's open donor fields.
  - Corrected: SCAN-B GSE96058 holds 3,273 patients with median follow-up 52 months, where the draft gave 3,217 and 75 months, which belong to a later QC subset (Brueffer et al. 2020) that GEO does not mark. GDC's neoadjuvant and prior-malignancy annotations are notifications, not exclusions. lifelines 0.30.3 does not install in Pyodide 314.0.7 (it pins pandas < 3; Pyodide ships 3.0.2), while 0.30.0 installs and runs.
  - Qualified: the survival times' unit in days rests on a secondary README; a distant-metastasis interval depends on a field TCGA did not require (648 patients who died with tumour have no new tumour event recorded).
- **Lessons.** Six of `lessons5.md`'s seven were already in `knowledge/lessons.md`; the seventh, counting open decisions from the file, was added, and the three-question rule gained a note that two check-ins today asked four.
- **Open decisions,** counted from the table after the merge: none. D1–D9 and D11–D28 are resolved and D10 is superseded.
- **No frozen file changed,** so the rules are not registered again here; `~/ctx_tier1/data/raw` still held only `tier1_meta` at 2026-09-29 15:27.

**Consequence.** M10 is planned for Phase 4, breast first, and its linked swimmer plot uses the linked-view controls built in P2Q.4. The drafts moved to `../RNAseq_tutorial_archive/TEMP_2026-09-29b/`.

## D-020 — Rytis's drafts v3.4 and v3.6 merged; the reuse layer follows the Step-1 record

**Date:** 2026-09-29 · **Status:** decided

**Context.** Rytis put two parallel drafts of the plan in `TEMP/`, draft v3.4 and draft v3.6, and asked for "more adjustability in selecting result visualisation, and an ability to easily repeat this whole analysis and generate these reports by providing different RNA-seq datasets". Both drafts branched from TODO.md before Phase 1b and Phase 2 were recorded.
- **Draft v3.4** adds:
  - M9 gene cards;
  - an M2 QC atlas;
  - the nf-core/rnaseq reference run.
- **Draft v3.6** adds:
  - cohort bundles with `--cohort`;
  - a Reproduce panel per figure, with `ctx figure`.
- **What both drafts restate.** They restate rules the repo has since changed, and they reuse the decision numbers D14 to D20 for different decisions.

**Options.**
- Copy a draft over TODO.md and CONVENTIONS.md. That would undo D5, D14, D16, D18, D-011, D-012, D-019, the 18 px base and the Step names.
- Merge item by item, keeping every later repo decision, with Rytis's choices where a draft changes direction.

**Decision.** Merge item by item. What was carried, what was not and why is recorded in TODO.md, "Merge of drafts v3.4 and v3.6". Rytis's choices on 2026-09-29:

| Question | Choice |
|---|---|
| M9 gene cards | Yes, Phase 4, output number 11. Step-1's worked examples are the `box_genes` registered before any count. |
| M2 QC atlas | Yes. The checkpoint runs in Track B too, from Phase 3. |
| Step-1 cohort QC | Sample-level checks only. MultiQC stays on the cluster (critique M3). |
| The drafts in `TEMP/` | Moved out of the repo. |
| When to build the reuse layer: cohort bundles, `ctx run`, `ctx figure`, Reproduce panels | After the Step-1 record, as Phase 2D. |
| The volcano's `lfc_type` | The x axis may show the shrunk estimate for display. Colours always follow the call on the raw estimate (D-012), and the page says so. This reverses the page control D-019 turned down, by Rytis's choice. On a shrunk axis the vertical fold-change lines are not drawn, because the call's threshold applies to the raw estimate; `x_estimate = "shrunk"` is refused, with the reason, when `--no-lfc-shrink` left the shrunk columns empty. |
| Figure parameter models | Frozen dataclasses, as `src/ctx/dataset.py` validates, not pydantic. |

- **Renumbering.** Draft decisions get new numbers:
  - D14 to D16 of v3.4 become D21 to D23;
  - D18 to D20 of v3.6 become D24 to D26;
  - D17 of v3.4 is already covered by D18 and D-006.
- **`ctx run`.** This is not in either draft. It is added as the direct answer to "easily repeat this whole analysis with a different dataset".

**Evidence.**
- **Diff and plan.** Six section agents, one fact-check pass, a planner and a critic.
  - The diff produced 181 items.
  - 89 claims were checked at their sources: 86 verified, 2 wrong and corrected, 1 unverified.
  - The critique found 21 problems in the first plan, all fixed before any edit.
  - The v3.6 claims: 21 of its new claims were checked at their sources: 16 verified, 3 wrong in detail and corrected, 2 partly verified and marked so.
- **Frozen rule sources.** Registered rules R1, R2 and R7 cited "TODO.md:360" and "TODO.md:364". The merge moved those lines, so the sources now name their target ("TODO.md, Verification: …") and cannot go stale again.
  - That changes the frozen `conf/datasets/tier1.toml`, so the rules are registered again.
  - At 2026-09-29 14:00, `~/ctx_tier1/data/raw` held only `tier1_meta`.
- **Line references inside TODO.md** were remapped to the lines they pointed at.
- **Tests.** `pixi run preflight` passes on the merged files.

**Consequence.**
- Phase 2D sits between the Step-1 record and Phase 3.
- Any draft item marked UNVERIFIED stays so until it is read at its source.
- Step 7 of the cluster block waits for this registration commit.

## D-019 — LFC shrinkage is a switch, on by default

**Date:** 2026-09-29 · **Status:** decided; its rejected page control is partly taken up by D-020 (the volcano's x axis may show the shrunk estimate for display)

**Context.** Rytis asked for an option to turn off LFC shrinkage, on by default, with an explanation of what it does. `ctx de` always ran apeGLM shrinkage. Its output feeds two places only:
- the `log2FoldChange_shrunk` and `lfcSE_shrunk` columns;
- the MA plot.

The test, the p-values, the call, the volcano and the enrichment use the raw estimate (D-012).

**Options.**
- A switch on `ctx de`, with the parameter card that every CLI option carries.
- A control on the page that swaps the estimate the figures show. That would put the shrunk fold change beside a call made on the raw one, which D-012 decided against.

**Decision.** `ctx de --lfc-shrink/--no-lfc-shrink`, on by default.
- **Defined once.** The default is `ctx.de.deseq.LFC_SHRINK`, and the CLI's default is tested against it.
- **When off,** `fit(shrink=False)` skips the second `DeseqStats` and its `lfc_shrink`, and leaves the two shrunk columns empty. The MA plot draws the raw estimate alone, and its caption, lead and reading say that shrinkage was off.
- **The card.** It says what shrinkage does: it pulls each fold change toward 0 as far as its counts leave it uncertain, so a weakly expressed gene cannot top a ranking on noise. It also says what turning it off changes.
- **How a switch's default prints.** A switch's card and its test now print the default as "on" or "off", where "True" would have appeared.
- **CONVENTIONS.md** says shrunken and raw LFC are both available. It now names the switch.

**Evidence.**
- **Nothing tested or called changes.** Synthetic `ctx de`, 6 contrasts, run with and without the switch:
  - all six results tables are equal in every column but the two shrunk ones, which are empty when off;
  - the metrics, contrasts and sex-check tables are identical.
- **Time.** 32.71 s wall with shrinkage and 31.62 s without, both at 0.58 GB peak, on 1,000 genes. The card promises no speed-up.
- **Tests.**
  - `test_de.py::test_no_shrink_changes_nothing_tested` compares the two fits column by column.
  - `test_ma_draws_the_estimates_the_fit_has` checks the MA plot's series and its text.
  - `test_cli.py::test_lfc_shrink_reaches_the_fit` checks that the flag reaches `run` in both spellings and by default.
  - `test_lfc_shrink_default_single_source` checks the default against `LFC_SHRINK`.
  - Three mutants each fail one of these tests: shrinking whatever the switch says, the CLI dropping the flag, and the MA plot always drawing both series.
- **In the browser.** The shrinkage-off page shows the card with default "on", its effect text and `--no-lfc-shrink` in the reproduce command. The MA page draws one series, "raw estimate", for 997 genes. The default page still draws both series.
- **Registered again.** `src/ctx/de` is frozen. At 2026-09-29 10:20, `~/ctx_tier1/data/raw` held only `tier1_meta`.

**Consequence.** A table written with the switch off has empty shrunk columns. A reader ranking genes needs shrinkage on, and the page's "In practice" advice still says to rank by the shrunk estimate.

## D-018 — The M5 page says what BH promises and when it does not hold

**Date:** 2026-09-29 · **Status:** decided

**Context.** The M5 glossary said BH and BY "control the false discovery rate", with no condition attached. D-017 measured that DESeq2's Wald p-values run small because each gene's estimated dispersion is taken as known. On synthetic data, the share of false genes at padj < 0.05 is therefore about twice what BH promises. Rytis asked for the small-sample caveat on the page.

**Options.**
- A caveat that uses this run's own numbers. No run knows its false genes, so there are none to fill in.
- A fixed, measured example, stated with what it was measured on.

**Decision.** The measured example, on the M5 page in two places:
- **Glossary.** The BH and BY line now says they control the false discovery rate "when the p-values are exact".
- **Common mistakes.** A new entry covers reading padj < 0.05 as at most 5 % false genes. BH bounds the average share, and only when the p-values of unchanged genes are exact. The entry gives the measured numbers below.

**Evidence.** Measured on the committed `tests/synth.py` `design_counts` defaults: 6 vs 6, 1,000 genes, 100 of them changed, seeds 0 to 199, one fit each.

| Share of false genes | Mean | Standard error | Max |
|---|---|---|---|
| BH's promise, 0.05 × m0/m | 0.045 | | |
| padj < 0.05, any fold change | 0.084 | 0.0019 | 0.149 |
| the page's call, which also needs abs(log2 FC) ≥ 1 | 0.032 | 0.0012 | 0.084 |

D-017 gives the cause. With the true dispersion put in place, the null p-values are nominal, and R DESeq2 1.46.0 gives the same excess as ctx.

**Consequence.**
- **Frozen file.** `src/ctx/de/page.py` is frozen, so this commit registers again. At 2026-09-29 10:10, `~/ctx_tier1/data/raw` held only `tier1_meta`.
- **Fixed numbers.** The numbers in the mistake are a fixed reference, not this run's. If `design_counts`, the call rule or pydeseq2 changes, they have to be measured again.

---

## D-017 — Synthetic dispersion follows a trend; the planted tests rest on measured spreads

**Date:** 2026-09-28 · **Status:** decided

**Context.** Preflight printed four kinds of warning. Two came from pydeseq2:
- "The dispersion trend curve fitting did not converge" on seven fits;
- "overflow encountered in exp" on one.

The first had a root cause in `tests/synth.py`: `design_counts` gave every gene the same dispersion, 0.1. With no trend to fit, pydeseq2's parametric fit fails and falls back to the mean. With zero true spread, the dispersion prior's variance also sits at its floor of 0.25. Giving the data a trend broke three tests at seed 7, and each of them had been passing by the draw.

**Options.**
- Keep the flat data and assert pydeseq2's warning where it appears. That is honest about the data, but it fixes nothing.
- Give the data a trend and re-measure every planted assertion over many seeds.

**Decision.** A trend, with each assertion set from measured spreads.

- **Generator.** `design_counts` draws dispersion as (0.05 + 10 / mean) × exp(N(0, 0.3)). That is setting C7, the best of 8 settings swept.
- **Filtered fixture.** `filtered_counts` adds 1,500 low null genes at mean 20, dispersed the same way, where it used to add 600 flat ones.
- **Planted FDP bound.** In `test_planted_recovered`, the FDP bound on the padj < 0.05 set is 0.20; the page's call keeps 0.10.
- **Null split.** The CLI test holds the null split to rule S1, at most 1 % of tested genes, where it used to require zero.
- **Significant against called.** The CLI assertion that significant differs from up plus down needed a chance false positive. `test_de.py::test_significant_counts_any_fold_change` now checks the same thing on a constructed gene.

**Evidence.**
- **Why BH's 0.05 is not the bound.**
  - Setup: all genes null, 6 vs 6, flat data at donor SD 0, seeds 0 to 24, 74,884 genes.
  - ctx's p-values fall below 0.05, 0.01 and 0.001 at rates of 0.0595, 0.0148 and 0.0021.
  - With the true dispersion put in place they are 0.0516, 0.0102 and 0.0012.
  - Plain pydeseq2 gives ctx's rates to four decimals. So does R DESeq2 1.46.0 on all 9,000 genes of the same matrices, seeds 0 to 2.
  - So the excess comes from the method, which takes an estimated dispersion as known. ctx does not cause it.
  - Two skeptics could not refute this. One reproduced it on seeds 10 to 14, and the ctx arm and the true-dispersion arm disagree beyond chance (McNemar p = 1.2e-4 at 0.001).
- **The planted FDP, under C7, 6 vs 6, 1,000 genes, 100 planted:**

| Set | Seeds | Mean | Max | Bound |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| padj < 0.05, any fold change | 0 to 199 | 0.083 to 0.084 | 0.149 | 0.20 |
| the page's call, with abs(log2 FC) ≥ 1 | 0 to 199 | not recorded | 0.084 | 0.10 |
| raw p < 0.05, no correction | 0 to 199 | 0.353, on seeds 0 to 99 | minimum 0.273 | caught by 0.20 |

- **Trend-warning fits per setting.** The eight settings, summed over the seven test designs:

| Setting | a0 | a1 | scatter | Fits with the warning |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| C0 | 0.1 | 0 | 0 | 313 of 480 |
| C7 | 0.05 | 10 | 0.3 | 22 of 480, all in the old 600-gene fixture; 0 with the new one |

  On fresh seeds 100 to 119, C7 raised 0 such warnings in every `test_de` and `test_stats` fit. It raised 1 in 160 fits of the CLI's contrasts: b_case, seed 107.
- **The new fixture, measured on the committed code.** Over seeds 0 to 29 and 100 to 119:
  - the reasons hold on 50 of 50 seeds;
  - independent filtering removes at least 141 genes;
  - no fit warns.
- **Seed 7, the seed the tests use.** The warning-free result is from a pytest run of the test files.

| Quantity | Value |
|---|---|
| padj-set FDP | 0.107 |
| called-set FDP | 0.048 |
| raw-only genes | 13 |
| genes removed by independent filtering | 748 |
| paired vs unpaired, true genes significant | 80 vs 0 |
| paired vs unpaired, true genes called | 46 vs 0 |
| pydeseq2 warnings in these fits | none |

- **Preflight and budget.**
  - Preflight: 344 passed, 4 skipped, 0 warnings, 148 s wall, 1.63 GB peak.
  - The 60,000-gene budget test passes: `ctx de` in 296 s with an 11.0 MB page, `ctx function` in 15.3 s.
- **The metric test discriminates.** Counting the significant metric with the fold-change filter fails the new unit test.
- **The overflow is upstream.** It is scverse/PyDESeq2 issue 169, open on 0.5.4, the newest release, at `utils.py:1088` inside `lfc_shrink`. On C7 it appears in 12 of 30 unpaired fits at donor SD 1.0, never at seed 7. It is not suppressed. A fix that rewrites `1 / (1 + size·exp(-η))` as `expit(η - log size)` is drafted in the session scratchpad, not posted. It leaves raw log fold changes and p-values bit-identical, and moves shrunken ones by at most 5.6e-12.

**Consequence.**
- **Synthetic numbers change.** Every synthetic count matrix from `design_counts` differs, so the example pages drawn from it change too.
- **The FDP bound is tied to this generator.** 0.20 was measured on C7 alone. Pooled over all 8 settings, the FDP reached 0.198.
- **Not done: the student page.** The page states that BH controls the FDR at 0.05, with no small-sample caveat. It is unchanged.
- **Not done: the layout-check crash.** On 3 of 20 fresh seeds, `ctx de` stopped at the box figure's layout check, on overlapping p and r labels. That is a separate fault, and it is not fixed here.

## D-016 — Registered again for the fixes an adversarial review of D-015 found

**Date:** 2026-09-28 · **Status:** decided

**Context.** An adversarial review of commit f95010b (D-015) gave 10 findings. One skeptic per finding tried to refute it; 8 survived, and one of those was reported twice. None changes a shipped page. The fixes touch `src/ctx/de/stats.py` and `conf/datasets/tier1.toml`, which are frozen (D-013).

**Options.**
- Leave the frozen files as they are and correct only the tests and documents.
- Register again, which is allowed while no Step-1 count exists.

**Decision.** Register again, and fix each finding:

| Finding | Fix |
|---|---|
| `p_line`'s "if and only if" breaks at the last bit | The docstring and D-015 say where it holds, and a `ponytail:` comment names the clamp that would close it |
| `tests/test_viz.py`'s live-volcano fixture drew the old line, with n_tested 7 against 8 tested rows | It computes its line with `p_line` over its tested rows; the test writes the bar out as 5 × 0.05 / 8 |
| Nothing checked that the static line equals the line the page script draws on load | `tests/test_page_script.py::test_static_line_is_the_line_the_page_draws_on_load` runs `run._volcano` on a fit with filtered genes through `figure_block` and the page script |
| A viz test still expected no line when nothing passes | It now expects the first bar; a second test keeps the contract's own no-line state |
| The registration comment, TODO.md and D-012 still described the old line or `p_cutoff` | Updated in place, with pointers to D-015 |
| D-015 overstated its test coverage | Reworded, and the tightness test now runs at 0.01 as well |

**Evidence.**
- **The parity test discriminates.** A producer that counts m over every gene, not the tested ones, passes on the default design, where every gene is tested. On `tests/synth.py::filtered_counts`, where Cook's and independent filtering remove genes, it fails. That helper now builds this matrix for `test_de`, `test_stats` and the parity test, in place of two inline copies.
- **No count exists.** At 2026-09-28 21:45, `~/ctx_tier1/data/raw` held only `tier1_meta`.
- **Refuted findings, not acted on.** Two findings were refuted:
  - `ScatterData.all_lines` raises on an empty frame. That happens before f95010b too, so this commit did not cause it.
  - `tests/synth.py`'s no-line sentence can show only when no gene was tested.

**Consequence.** Step 7 of the cluster block waits for this registration commit.

## D-015 — The volcano's cutoff line sits at the bar the weakest passing gene cleared

**Date:** 2026-09-28 · **Status:** decided

**Context.** Rytis reported that the volcano's p-value cutoff "doesn't seem to work properly": only some cutoffs moved the dashed line. The line sat at the largest raw p among passing genes (D-012). That value moves only when a gene crosses the cutoff, and no gene's BH-adjusted p lay between several of the preset cutoffs, so the line stood still between them.

**Options.**
- Keep the line at the weakest passing gene and explain on the page why it does not move.
- Draw the line at the bar the procedure itself sets, which moves with every cutoff and still separates passing from failing genes.

**Decision.** The procedure's own bar, defined once in `ctx.de.stats.p_line` and repeated in `ctxCalls.line` in `templates/_calls.js.j2`. With m tested genes, k of them passing and j = max(k, 1):

| Basis | Line on the raw-p scale |
|---|---|
| raw p | α |
| BH | j·α/m |
| BY | j·α/(m·c(m)), with c(m) = 1 + 1/2 + ... + 1/m |
| Holm | α/(m − j + 1) |
| Bonferroni | α/m |

A tested gene passes if and only if its raw p is below the line, in exact arithmetic. In floating point, a p within one unit in the last place of the bar can land on either side. The review behind D-016 built such cases from p-values on the bar's own double, and found 0 of them in 1,600 settings with continuous p-values. When no gene passes, the line is the first bar, the one the strongest gene would have had to clear. A line is missing only when no gene was tested.

**Evidence.**
- **Before and after, on the same page.** Synthetic M5 volcano, 999 tested genes, BH, measured in the browser pane:

| Cutoff | Genes passing | Old line, -log10 p | New line, -log10 p |
|---|---|---|---|
| 0.1 | 106 | 2.00 | 1.97 |
| 0.05 | 103 | 2.32 | 2.29 |
| 0.02 | 100 | 4.85 | 2.70 |
| 0.01 | 100 | 4.85 | 3.00 |
| 0.005 | 100 | 4.85 | 3.30 |
| 0.001 | 100 | 4.85 | 4.00 |

- **The line still separates.** At 30 settings, 5 bases times 6 cutoffs, 0 tested genes on the page sit on the wrong side of the drawn line.
- **Tested in `tests/test_stats.py`.**
  - At every basis and four cutoffs, the line splits passing from failing genes.
  - At every basis and four cutoffs, the weakest passing gene still passes when moved to 1 − 1e-9 of the line, and fails at 1 + 1e-9. The first commit tested three cutoffs here; D-016 added 0.01.
  - The reported case, BH only: cutoffs 0.05 and 0.02 call the same genes and give lines 2.5 times apart.
- **The page script is tested against Python.** `tests/test_page_script.py` checks the page script's line against `p_line` over 80 settings. The BY constant is summed pairwise by numpy and in order by the page, so the two agree to a relative 1e-12.
- **Five mutants fail the tests:**
  - k in place of max(k, 1);
  - (k + 1)·α/m for BH;
  - α/(m − k) for Holm;
  - BY without c(m);
  - the page's BH line times 1.01.
- **Registered again.** `src/ctx/de` is frozen (D-013), so this commit changes `[sanity] registered`. At 2026-09-28 21:24, `~/ctx_tier1/data/raw` held only `tier1_meta`. A search under `~/ctx_tier1` for counts, salmon, rnaseq or quant files found nothing.

**Consequence.** The line's height and the reading sentence "above the dashed line at -log10 p = X" change for every volcano, in the PDF and on the page. The calls, counts and tables do not change. The no-line sentence now covers only the case where no gene was tested.

## D-014 — The cohort tiers are called Steps; pages show a dataset's label

**Date:** 2026-09-28 · **Status:** decided

**Context.** Rytis asked for "tier1" and the other tiers to read "Step-1", "Step-2" and "Step-3". A dataset's slug names every output file, and file names are lowercase with underscores, so "Step-1" cannot be a slug.

**Options.**
- Change only the shown name and the prose.
- Rename the slug and every path to `step1`: the dataset file, output names, `~/ctx_tier1` and the cluster paths.
- Change the prose only.

**Decision.** The shown name and the prose; this is Rytis's choice of 2026-09-28.
- `[dataset] label = "Step-1"` in `conf/datasets/tier1.toml`, read through `Dataset.name`, is what page titles and the hub show. Without a label a page shows the slug.
- The documents, test comments and page text say Step-1, Step-2 and Step-3 wherever they meant a cohort tier: 99 replacements. "data tier", which means access level, is untouched.
- The slug `tier1`, every file name, `conf/datasets/tier1.toml`, `~/ctx_tier1` and the cluster paths keep `tier1`, so nothing already built or running is renamed under it.

**Evidence.**
- **The freeze, handled.** The dataset file is frozen (D-013), so the rules were registered again in the same commit that adds the label. `[sanity] registered` carries a time, so each registration changes that line.
- **No count exists.** On 2026-09-28 at the registration, `~/ctx_tier1/data/raw` held only `tier1_meta`, and a search for counts, salmon or rnaseq under `~/ctx_tier1` found nothing.
- **The label is tested.** `tests/test_curation.py::test_label_is_the_name_pages_show`.

**Consequence.** A future dataset can carry any label. Its slug stays the file-name token, and the two can differ.

## D-013 — The Step-1 sanity rules are registered again, before any count exists

**Date:** 2026-09-28 · **Status:** decided

**Context.** The rules were registered on 2026-09-27 in commit 8219d16. `tests/test_sanity_record.py::test_rule_unchanged` then froze every file a verdict depends on, until the record commit:
- `src/ctx/de` and `src/ctx/function`;
- `src/ctx/viz/annotate.py` and `src/ctx/report/hub.py`;
- the dataset files.

The page redesign had to change those files: the call rule (D-012), the page text and the PERMANOVA without a movable label. Two of the rules, R3 and R7, also moved to the `significant` metric.

**Options.**
- **Two phases.** Change the pages now, and M5, M6 and the hub only after the record, when the cluster run is done.
- **Narrow the freeze list,** which would still mean one edit to frozen files.
- **Register again,** before any count exists.

**Decision.** Register again. This is Rytis's choice of 2026-09-28.
- The `[sanity]` table of `conf/datasets/tier1.toml` now holds `registered = "2026-09-28"`.
- `rule_commit()` returns the newest commit that changed that line. The record must still come after it, and the freeze runs from it.
- R1 to R8 keep their thresholds. R3 and R7 read `calls.<c>.significant`, BH padj < 0.05 at any fold change, which is the meaning they had, now under an explicit name.

**Evidence that no count existed at registration.** On 2026-09-28, before this commit:
- `~/ctx_tier1/data/raw` held only `tier1_meta`, the metadata-only fetchngs run.
- `find ~/ctx_tier1 -iname '*counts*'` and `-iname '*salmon*'` found nothing.
- No cluster step had returned output to this Mac. The cluster block's step 7, the only step that copies counts here, waits for this commit.

**Consequence.**
- **The freeze.** Any change to a frozen path between this commit and the record fails `test_rule_unchanged` when the record is committed.
- **Registering once more** is allowed only while no count exists, and needs the same evidence line.
- **An early warning** was first left out, because it blocks every M5 or M6 fix before P2C.3 until the rules are registered again. On Rytis's request of 2026-09-28 it was added: `tests/test_sanity_record.py::test_frozen_since_registration`. Until the record exists, it fails as soon as a frozen path differs from the registration commit, committed, uncommitted or untracked, and names the two ways out.

## D-012 — A gene is called at padj < 0.05 and |log2 FC| at least 1; four adjustments on the page

**Date:** 2026-09-28 · **Status:** decided

**Context.** Rytis asked every figure to say in practice what it shows, with the thresholds, and the volcano to take the reader's own cutoffs. Until then a call was BH padj < 0.05 signed by the raw fold change, with no fold-change threshold, so the volcano had no x cutoff to name.

**Options.**
- Keep padj alone and say that the x cutoff is 0.
- Filter the fold change after the Wald test.
- Test against the threshold, as DESeq2's `lfcThreshold` does, which needs a Wald test per threshold.
- Guide lines at plus or minus 1 without changing the call.

**Decision.** These are Rytis's choices of 2026-09-28:
- **Call rule.** Called means BH padj < 0.05 and |raw log2 FC| at least 1, the fold change filtered after the test. It is `ctx.de.stats.classify`, the one definition.
- **Volcano controls.** The page volcano lets the reader choose:
  - the fold-change threshold, in log2 or as a percent;
  - the p basis: the BH, BY, Holm or Bonferroni adjusted p, or the raw p;
  - the cutoff, from 0.0001 to 0.1.
- **Adjustments.** They come from the same Wald p-values over the genes pydeseq2's BH kept, so no refit is needed. `deseq.py` stores `padj_by`, `padj_holm` and `padj_bonferroni`.
- **Sanity rules.** R3 and R7 test the model's false positives and power, which a fold-change filter would flatter. They read `calls.<c>.significant`, padj < 0.05 at any fold change.

**Evidence.**
- **BH.** Our BH equals pydeseq2's `padj` exactly: the maximum difference is 0.0 on a fit with 1,071 tested genes, 527 independently filtered and 1 Cook's outlier. BH over all 1,598 p-values differs by up to 0.0933, so the tested set matters.
- **Other methods.** All four methods equal statsmodels `multipletests` to 2.2e-16.
- **Planted truth, old rule against new:**

  | Measure | Old rule | New rule |
  |---|---|---|
  | planted calls / false calls | 107 / 7 | 101 / 1 |
  | naive batch share | 0.980 | 0.890 |
  | adjusted batch share | 0.010 | 0.000 |

  All planted-truth tests pass unchanged.
- **Mutation checks.** Four mutations of the rule and the adjustments each failed a test (`tests/test_stats.py`, 47 tests).
- **Page.** On the synthetic M5 page, the live counts and the cutoff-line height equal a Python recount from the results parquet at 8 settings: all four methods, raw p, log2 and percent thresholds, and a fold-change threshold of 10 that no gene reaches. The branch for a cutoff no gene passes cannot be reached on this fixture, whose minimum cutoff of 0.0001 still passes genes, so it ran on a scratch copy of the page with every embedded p-value set to 0.5: the line hid, 0 up and 0 down, and the reading switched to its no-line sentence. Superseded by D-015: with no gene passing, the line now sits at the first bar and stays drawn.

**Consequence.**
- **Changed counts.** Every "up" and "down" count, the ORA input and the call-count bars now need the fold change, so they differ from pages written before 2026-09-28.
- **The height is not the call.** The volcano's height is the raw p-value. Its horizontal line sits at the largest raw p whose adjusted p passes, which is exact because each adjustment is monotone in p. The page says so. Superseded by D-015: the line now sits at the bar the weakest passing gene cleared, which moves with the cutoff.
- **Percent thresholds.** A percent is asymmetric in log2: +20 % is log2 1.2 = 0.263, and the same threshold down is 16.7 %. The page shows both.
- **Reversing it.** Going back would change the rule, the metrics names and the sanity rules. It would need a new registration (D-013).

## D-011 — The statistics caption sits under each interactive figure, not inside it

**Date:** 2026-09-28 · **Status:** decided

**Context.** Each interactive figure drew its caption as a plotly annotation and the page printed it again below. On the MA plot the annotation overlapped the x-axis title, measured in the browser on 2026-09-28, and the fixed-width annotation does not reflow on a phone.

**Options.**
- Keep the caption in the plot with its spacing fixed, so a PNG export keeps the statistics.
- Print it once, below the plot, as page text.

**Decision.** Printed once, below the plot. This is Rytis's choice of 2026-09-28.
- The PDFs and SVGs keep their caption in the figure.
- The plotly toolbar, and with it the PNG export, is off. That export would now carry no statistics, and over a phone-width plot the toolbar covered the legend.
- CONVENTIONS.md (Figures, the Plotly rule) now says where the caption goes.

**Evidence.** `test_round_trip` checks the caption tokens:
- in the page's caption, the PDF and the SVG;
- in none of the plot's annotations;
- the box figure's per-gene p and r labels stay drawn in the plot.

**Consequence.** Anyone who copies a plotly figure out of a page takes no statistics with it. The page's caption, the standalone figure page, the PDF and the SVG carry them; the CSV's README describes the columns, not the test.

## D-006 — Raw reads enter only through nf-core/fetchngs 1.12.0; `ctx gather` is the only ctx reader of its layout (TODO.md D18)

**Date:** 2026-09-26 · **Status:** decided

**Context.** `knowledge/recommendation1` (Rytis, 2026-09-26; moved out of the repo on 2026-09-27 to `/Users/rytis/Scripts/Pipeline/OLD/RNAseq_tutorial_recommendation1_2026-09-26/`) replaced custom ENA/`fastq-dl` download logic with nf-core/fetchngs 1.12.0 and split M1 into find, fetch and make usable. Its layout description followed the fetchngs docs; parts of it do not match the 1.12.0 code.

**Options.** Custom download code in ctx; fetchngs 1.12.0, which the lab runs on Kebnekaise; fetchngs 1.13.0 (released 2026-09-15, needs Nextflow >= 25.10.4, renames the versions file, changes the samplesheet row order, untested in the lab).

**Decision.** fetchngs 1.12.0 with `--nf_core_pipeline rnaseq`, one fresh outdir per run under `data/raw/<slug>/`, read-only to ctx; `ctx gather` (package `ctx/gather/`) is the only ctx module that reads it; no launcher and no ENA/SRA access code in ctx. The reader stays in ctx under D-003.

**Evidence.** From the 1.12.0 code (raw.githubusercontent.com/nf-core/fetchngs/1.12.0, retrieved 2026-09-26):
- File names `<EXP>_<RUN>[_1|_2].fastq.gz` (`bin/sra_runinfo_to_ftp.py:143-145`); `.md5` files only from FTP and Aspera, written from ENA's md5 and checked with `md5sum -c` (`modules/local/sra_fastq_ftp/main.nf:29,44,52`); the sra-tools fallback is automatic per run and writes no md5 (`workflows/sra/main.nf:79-81`).
- `*.runinfo.tsv` is not published (`modules/local/sra_ids_to_runinfo/nextflow.config:3-6`); `metadata/<INPUT_ID>.runinfo_ftp.tsv` is, one per input line.
- `--nf_core_pipeline rnaseq` only inserts `strandedness` = `auto` (`modules/local/sra_to_samplesheet/main.nf:33-49`); sheet paths are `<outdir as given>/fastq/<name>` (same file, `:24-53`).
- The input regex rejects `E-MTAB-*` (`subworkflows/local/utils_nfcore_fetchngs_pipeline/main.nf:144-165`); an SRR pulls every run of its experiment.
- Minimum Nextflow `!>=23.04.0` (`nextflow.config:223`); container images are amd64-only, so Apple silicon needs `-profile docker,arm` (`nextflow.config:110-112`).
- On Kebnekaise the lab runs 1.12.0 with `-profile singularity` on Nextflow 26.04.4, which needs `NXF_SYNTAX_PARSER=v1` (`General_tools/cluster_utils/SHARED_run_fetchngs.sbatch:56-77`; `cluster_utils/README.md`).

Observed while building the Phase 1b fixtures on this Mac (2026-09-26, `-profile docker,arm`, Nextflow 26.04.6):
- `metadata/*.runinfo_ftp.tsv` rows come in no fixed order: a rebuild swapped two runs of GSM4907283. `samplesheet.csv` came back byte-identical. ctx reads metadata as a set of runs; the rebuild test compares those files by rows.
- The sra-tools fasterq-dump step asks for 36 GB by default and fails on a 24 GB laptop; the fixture script caps the run at `--max_cpus 4 --max_memory 8.GB`.
- In one rebuild, `prefetch` inside the amd64-emulated sra-tools container failed to open the run from NCBI's S3 bucket and then sat idle, while the host reached the same URL in 0.4 s. The FTP runs were unaffected. Class runs should prefer runs with an ENA FASTQ link.

**Consequence.** An upgrade to 1.13.0 is one deliberate change: `FETCHNGS_VERSION`, a new fixture, and the renamed versions file. `ctx gather` refuses any other release until then.

**Addendum, 2026-09-27: two Nextflow warnings, the logs flag, and link publishing.**

Two warnings appeared on fetchngs runs from this Mac's default `~/.nextflow`; runs with a fresh `NXF_HOME`, such as the fixture builder's, showed only the second. Neither changed an output: ten metadata-only runs of one run accession (SRR13191702), with and without the fixes below, wrote byte-identical `samplesheet/` and `metadata/`; a one-run input has no row order to vary.

- **Multi-revision warning.** Its cause is the local asset cache, not ctx. `~/.nextflow/assets/nf-core/fetchngs` was a legacy single-revision clone; the clone dates point to Nextflow 25.10.4, which is inferred, not recorded. Nextflow 26.04 warns whenever it runs from a legacy clone (`CmdRun.groovy:640-644`). On Rytis's instruction, `nextflow pull nf-core/fetchngs -r 1.12.0 -migrate` was run on this Mac. It exited 0 in 9.87 s and added `~/.nextflow/assets/.repos/nf-core/fetchngs/{bare,clones/8ec2d934f9...}`: 7,312,049 bytes in 164 files, 7,588 KiB on disk. A `du -sh` right after the migrate read 8.4M; a review measured 7.4M with no file changed since, so the 8.4 first written here was wrong. The legacy clone stays in place, byte-identical across its 163 files, so deleting `.repos` reverts. The `nf-core/riboseq` legacy clone belongs to other projects and was not touched. A fresh cache under Nextflow 26 is multi-revision already, so students do not see this warning.
- **`monochromeLogs` warning.** Its cause is upstream. fetchngs 1.12.0 pins nf-validation 1.1.3, whose `paramsSummaryLog` reads the undefined `params.monochromeLogs` whenever `monochrome_logs` is false (`SchemaValidator.groovy:880-886`, tag 1.1.3; reported upstream as nf-schema#14). Nextflow 25.10.4 warns on the same run. fetchngs 1.13.0 moves to nf-schema and should not warn, but it was not run. Rytis chose `--monochrome_logs true` over a monochromeLogs-only parameter and over the 1.13.0 upgrade. It is a real fetchngs parameter (`nextflow_schema.json:210`); it removes both the warning and the colour codes from the log; and it sets `monochrome_logs` to true in `params_*.json`, which always carries the key (false by default), so that file's SHA-256 in gather's provenance changes. `tests/test_repo.py::test_fetchngs_runs_monochrome` is a guard, not a proof. It checks the M1b course command, the CONVENTIONS rule, the TODO and CONVENTIONS lines that route a run through the Kebnekaise launcher with `-profile singularity`, every fenced TODO block that calls the launcher (its `printf` write of the config), and every file under `scripts/` whose code names `nf-core/fetchngs`. The test's comments name what escapes it.
- **The Kebnekaise launcher takes no extra flags**, so the cluster run carries the setting in `<project_dir>/nfcore_fetchngs/nextflow.config`, the directory the launcher `cd`s into before `nextflow run` (`SHARED_run_fetchngs.sbatch:110,201`). Tested on this Mac the same day, with the cluster's config file and fetchngs started without the flag, as the launcher starts it:
  - `monochrome_logs = true` there reaches the run: the params file records it, and the log has 0 ANSI escapes and no monochromeLogs warning. It had no multi-revision warning either, but only because the cache had been migrated about three minutes earlier (the migrate ended 19:42:07, the run started 19:45:15); the config has no bearing on that warning.
  - `publish_dir_mode = "link"` there does NOT reach `publishDir`, which the module configs resolve while fetchngs's own config is parsed. `nextflow config` from that directory prints `publish_dir_mode = 'link'` among the params, yet `mode:'copy'` for `SRA_FASTQ_FTP`, and the published `metadata/*.runinfo_ftp.tsv` had 1 link.
  - `--publish_dir_mode link` on the command line does hard-link: the same file had 2 links.
  - So the cluster FASTQs are copied, not linked, and the Phase 2 cluster block now budgets for two copies (critique M1 settled). One copy would need the launcher to pass the flag, which is Rytis's call.
- **2026-09-28: the launcher passes the flag.** On Rytis's instruction, `General_tools/cluster_utils/SHARED_run_fetchngs.sbatch` gained a `PUBLISH_DIR_MODE` setting, passed as `--publish_dir_mode`. It is not committed in General_tools. Empty keeps fetchngs's copy, and a value outside the schema's enum (`nextflow_schema.json:193`) fails the preflight. Both arms ran through the launcher on this Mac for ERR1160846, one FTP run of 18,077 bytes. Two local stand-ins replaced cluster settings: a launch-directory config set the local executor, since the launcher exports `NXF_EXECUTOR=slurm`, and laptop caps.
  - With `link`, the FASTQ and its md5 each had 2 links and shared the inode of the file in `work/`. Without the setting, each had 1 link and a different inode.
  - Every file a process publishes was linked, 4 of 13. The other 9 are written by the launcher, by Nextflow's `pipeline_info`, or by `collectFile(storeDir:)` (`workflows/sra/main.nf:154,163,182`), and none is a FASTQ.
  - The cluster block's step 1 now sets `PUBLISH_DIR_MODE=link` and budgets for one copy. Whether the cluster filesystem hard-links is measured in step 3, not assumed.
- **The committed fixtures predate the flag** and stay as built; their READMEs record the command that made them. With the flag, a metadata_only rebuild matched the committed fixture in all 13 samplesheet and metadata files, and in its versions file. The timestamped params file and trace differed, the params file only in `monochrome_logs`. So did README.md, whose command row now carries the flag and a new date, and MANIFEST.sha256, which hashes those files. Two download rebuilds, the second a retry, stalled in `SRATOOLS_PREFETCH` for 10 min 22 s and 9 min 14 s, from the first prefetch submit in the execution trace to the SIGTERM that stopped them. Each prefetch task wrote one informational line and nothing more, with an empty `.command.trace`. That is the symptom of the stall recorded above; its cause was not logged this time. (A first version of this sentence said 10 min 23 s and 9 min 15 s, counted from the NCBI-settings task.)


**Correction 2026-09-29.** The Options paragraph says fetchngs 1.13.0 "changes the samplesheet row order". It changes the sort key: 1.12.0 sorts the per-sample files by their `<EXP>_<RUN>` name (`workflows/sra/main.nf:152`, `sort: { it.baseName }`), 1.13.0 sorts on the row text (`collectFile(sort: true)`, PR #379). The two orders differ only when one accession is a string prefix of another; on both committed fixtures they are the same (simulated; 1.13.0 was not run). The consequence stands: `ctx gather` reads by column name and compares runs as sets, now a rule in CONVENTIONS.md (D-020).


## D-005 — JupyterLite DE: precomputed grids plus live scipy tests, not live pydeseq2 (TODO.md D17)

**Date:** 2026-09-26 · **Status:** decided

**Context.** D4 left open whether the M5 notebook re-runs pydeseq2 in the browser. P1.5 fixed the
rule as `decide()` in `scripts/python/spike_pyodide.py`, committed in 247d3f5 before anything ran.
The record is `deliverables/2026-09-26_lite_build_pyodide_spike_v1.csv`.

**Options.** Live pydeseq2 0.5.4 in JupyterLite; the D4 fallback, precomputed grids plus live
scipy tests; live pydeseq2 under an in-process joblib backend, which the rule does not cover.

**Decision.** The fallback at all three grid sizes, 1,000 x 24, 20,000 x 24 and 20,000 x 200, with
plotly for figures. Stage B, the browser timing, did not run, because no size passed stage A.

The rule's "the `~ cell_type + condition` fit" was read as pydeseq2's default call. That reading
was fixed in the harness commit 4a54ff0, after a scratch dry run had shown the failure, not in the
rule commit 247d3f5. Under pydeseq2's public backend argument (the shim below) the 1,000 x 24 fit
meets every stage-A criterion, so the verdict at that size rests on the reading; how it was
settled is TODO.md D17. (The "D-005a" in AGENTS.md is the template's numbering, not this entry.)

**Evidence.** Stage A ran npm `pyodide@314.0.6`, Python 3.14.2, under Node v24.15.0 on macOS
15.7.9 arm64. npm integrity:
`sha512-BKDTJyIqFxC4BExLqeRS3f5xvXZIjOt8C3zGLN/Cc7tFxSwvKVhVkchQQ2AGLOtR4YrVOIFxbV8poyDOOmWwxQ==`.
- micropip installed pydeseq2 0.5.4 as 47 files of 41,800,855 bytes. anndata 0.13.4 arrived with
  typing-extensions 4.16.0 from PyPI, because the bundled 4.15.0 was never loaded, so the known
  risk did not fire in Node.
- The fit failed at every size. First blocking error, verbatim:
  `AssertionError: ThreadingBackend does not accept setting the inner_max_num_threads argument.`
  pydeseq2 0.5.4, the newest release on PyPI (https://pypi.org/pypi/pydeseq2/json, uploaded
  2026-01-23, retrieved 2026-09-26), wraps every inference call in
  `parallel_backend(self._backend, inner_max_num_threads=1)` (`default_inference.py:96`), where
  `backend` is a public `DefaultInference` argument that defaults to `"loky"`. Pyodide has no
  loky, joblib 1.5.3 falls back to threading, and threading rejects that argument. No version pin
  reaches it; the backend argument does.
- Loaded versions, Pyodide then CPython: numpy 2.4.6 and 2.5.3, scipy 1.18.0 and 1.18.1,
  scikit-learn 1.8.0 and 1.9.1, pandas 3.0.2 and 3.0.6, pydeseq2 0.5.4 in both.
- At 20,000 x 200, wheels plus data are 56,385,918 bytes, over the 50,000,000 limit, so that size
  fails even with a working fit.
- Fallback arm: in a Pyodide where `import pydeseq2` raises `ModuleNotFoundError`, scipy 1.18.0,
  pandas 3.0.2 and plotly 7.1.0 installed as 10 files of 32,226,431 bytes. Mann-Whitney U with BH
  matched CPython at every size: max |dp| 2.2e-16, max |dpadj| 5.6e-16, and no gene crossed 0.05.
- Recorded beside the rule, which never reads it: with a sequential joblib backend registered as
  `in_process`, pydeseq2 fits in Pyodide in 6.6, 38.5 and 44.8 s of Node time. It agrees at
  1,000 x 24 (0 disagreements, max |dLFC| 2.2e-5) and at 20,000 x 200 (0, 2.8e-4) but not at
  20,000 x 24: 389 disagreements. 388 are low-count genes, baseMean 0.27 to 1.34, whose padj is
  NaN in Pyodide only (CPython has none NaN); one of them, g05499, has CPython padj 0.0307. The
  389th is well expressed: g15471, baseMean 947.8, p 0.01027 against 0.003241, padj 0.0876
  against 0.0318. The largest p difference is 0.0381 (g01437, baseMean 1208.6). So the fits
  differ beyond independent filtering. Recomputed on 2026-09-26 from the run's raw results files.
- The record's `wheels_downloaded_bytes` holds the bytes of unique package files by name, not
  the bytes downloaded: formulaic, interface_meta and python_dotenv were each fetched twice
  (41,957,904 bytes of wheels fetched against 41,800,855 recorded), and 785,537 bytes of index
  pages and `.metadata` files are excluded. The Pyodide runtime is excluded as well:
  `pyodide.asm.wasm` 9,598,218 and `python_stdlib.zip` 2,545,564 bytes (npm package 314.0.6).
- The fallback's own budget at 20,000 x 200: 32,226,431 bytes of wheels plus 14,585,063 bytes of
  input leave 3,188,506 bytes of the 50,000,000 for the precomputed grids, before the runtime.
- Known gap in the pre-registered rule, left unedited: when both pydeseq2 version rows are
  missing, the version criterion compares None with None and passes. The record carries both
  versions, so this verdict is unaffected; a rerun must fix the rule first, in its own commit.
- Sources, retrieved 2026-09-26: https://registry.npmjs.org/pyodide (314.0.6 integrity; npm
  `latest` is 314.0.7, published 2026-09-14);
  https://registry.npmjs.org/@jupyterlite/pyodide-kernel/-/pyodide-kernel-0.8.6.tgz (devDependency
  `pyodide` 314.0.6); https://pypi.org/pypi/anndata/0.13.4/json (`typing-extensions>=4.16`).

**Consequence.** Phase 5 bundles precomputed DE grids and runs the scipy tests live. Reversing this
needs a new decision: the backend shim changes the notebook's code path, 20,000 x 24 still
disagrees under it, its wheels alone take 41.8 MB of the 50 MB budget, and no browser timing
exists. A numpy change that alters `counts()` fails `tests/test_spike_record.py`; the spike is
then rerun. The proof that the rule predates the record needs full history, so it runs locally
and skips in CI's depth-1 checkout.

## D-004 — Output root: the laptop profile defaults to the working directory; hpc needs an explicit root

**Date:** 2026-09-26 · **Status:** decided

**Context.** `settings/paths.toml` refuses guessed roots, because on the cluster a fallback
writes where nobody looks. Students run `ctx` from a course folder on a laptop.

**Options.** Always require `--root` or `CTX_ROOT`; default to the working directory everywhere;
default to it on the laptop profile only.

**Decision.** `--root`, then `CTX_ROOT`, then the working directory on `laptop`. `hpc` raises
without an explicit root. The resolved root is printed and written into every `_README.md`.

**Evidence.** None measured; this is a preference. The cluster risk is the one the template's
`settings/paths.toml` comment records.

**Consequence.** P1.6 tests the precedence. Reversing it changes where every student output lands.

## D-003 — ctx does not import labcore at runtime (TODO.md D15)

**Date:** 2026-09-26 · **Status:** decided

**Context.** `AGENTS.md` routes every reusable helper through the pinned `labcore` package.

**Options.** Depend on labcore after upstream changes (inline plotly, a theme toggle, a unit
column), or keep ctx self-contained with labcore in the environment for `labdocs` only.

**Decision.** Self-contained. Chosen by Rytis at the 2026-09-26 check-in.

**Evidence.** In labcore v0.6.6: `viz/save.py:147` writes plotly HTML with
`include_plotlyjs="cdn"`, one file per theme; the `write_table` README dictionary is
`Column | Dtype | Description`, with no unit (`io.py:239-273`); a CSV write is refused unless
`settings/formats.toml` lists it or `override=True` is passed; the Okabe-Ito order at
`viz/palette.py:60-61` puts `#CC79A7` fourth and `#F0E442` seventh, the reverse of
`CONVENTIONS.md`.

**Consequence.** Conformance level 5 ("labcore used for viz/IO") is unreachable. P1.2 adds an
AST test that fails on any `labcore` import under `src/ctx`.

## D-002 — Plan files moved to the template's locations; project rules live in CONVENTIONS.md (TODO.md D14)

**Date:** 2026-09-26 · **Status:** decided

**Context.** Copier owns `CLAUDE.md` and does not skip it when it exists. `TODO.md` and
`knowledge/lessons.md` are skip-if-exists, and on this case-insensitive disk `TODO.md` already
resolved to the root `todo.md`.

**Options.** Move and import (chosen); merge the project rules into `AGENTS.md`; keep the files at
the root and hand-merge `CLAUDE.md`.

**Decision.** `todo.md` became `TODO.md`, `lessons.md` became `knowledge/lessons.md`, and
`CLAUDE.md` became `CONVENTIONS.md`, which the generated `CLAUDE.md` imports. Where
`CONVENTIONS.md` conflicts with `AGENTS.md`, `CONVENTIONS.md` wins. `/data/`, `/resources/` and a
`tests/fixtures/**` re-include were added to `.gitignore`.

**Evidence.** Commit 45632ed is exactly three `R100` renames. The `copier copy` log (v0.9.10) has
0 overwrites and `conflict`/`skip` for `TODO.md` and `knowledge/lessons.md` only; all three files
kept their SHA-256.

**Consequence.** `copier update` merges against two short project additions in `CLAUDE.md` and
`AGENTS.md` instead of the whole rule set. They sit at the top of each file, after the import and
after the intro paragraph, not at the end: a real update to a synthetic template release that
appended to both files left conflict markers in each while the lines were appended, and merged
cleanly once they were moved (P1.11, 2026-09-26). A template change to those top lines would still
conflict; that is the smallest surface available.

## D-001 — `src/ctx` is an installable package, an exception to "no shared helper module"

**Date:** 2026-09-26 · **Status:** decided

**Context.** `AGENTS.md` puts every runnable step in `scripts/<lang>/` and forbids a shared
helper module in the repo; `labdocs` walks only `scripts/`, `bin/` and `containers/`.

**Options.** A typer CLI package in `src/ctx`, or scripts only.

**Decision.** The teaching product is the `ctx` package in `src/` (`CONVENTIONS.md`, Stack).
One-off steps such as fixture builders and spikes stay in `scripts/python/` with codebase-meta
blocks.

**Evidence.** None measured; this is a requirement: students install and run one CLI.

**Consequence.** `labdocs` does not document `src/ctx`, `knowledge/api_index.md` does not index
it, and the file-length ratchet does not cover it. Conformance stays at 1 until raised on purpose.
